# Mortgage Payoff Calculator

A mobile-first React Native application built with Expo that helps users calculate how additional monthly principal payments affect their mortgage payoff date and total interest paid.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Mortgage Calculator
- Input loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and additional payments
- Calculate new payoff date and interest savings
- Compare original vs accelerated payment schedules

### ðŸ“ˆ Visual Analytics
- Interactive chart showing loan balance over time
- Side-by-side comparison of payment scenarios
- Clear visualization of time and money saved

### ðŸ¤– AI Assistant (OpenAI Integration)
- Natural language mortgage queries powered by GPT-3.5-turbo
- Ask questions like "How much sooner if I add $300 per month?"
- Intelligent parsing of payment amounts and timeframes
- Conversational responses with personalized calculations
- Secure REST API server for OpenAI integration
- Real-time API integration with fallback to local calculations

## Technology Stack

- **React Native** with Expo SDK 53
- **Expo Web** for browser compatibility
- **Express.js** REST API server for OpenAI integration
- **react-native-chart-kit** for data visualization
- **react-native-svg** for chart rendering
- Functional components with React Hooks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mortgage_payoff_calculator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
# Start both API server and web client (recommended)
npm run dev

# Start development server (all platforms)
npm start

# Start web development server only
npm run web

# Start API server only
npm run server

# Start API server with auto-reload (development)
npm run server:dev

# Start Android development
npm run android

# Start iOS development  
npm run ios
```

### Building
```bash
# Build for production (all platforms)
npx expo export

# Build web version only
npx expo export:web
```

### Stopping the Server
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the development server

## Usage

1. **Start the app**: Run `npm start` or `npm run web`
2. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8081` for web version
3. **Input mortgage details**: Fill out the form with your loan information
4. **View results**: See your payoff calculations and savings
5. **Ask the AI**: Use natural language to explore different scenarios

## Example Queries for AI Assistant

- "How much sooner will I pay off my loan if I add $300 per month?"
- "Can I finish my mortgage in 20 years if I add more principal?"
- "What is the total interest I'll save with $500 extra per month?"
- "How much do I need to add monthly to pay off in 15 years?"

## REST API Endpoints

### POST /api/chat
Send mortgage-related queries to the AI assistant.

**Request:**

{
  "response": "Adding $300 per month would save you...",
  "tokens": 245,
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
}
```

### GET /api/health
Check server status and configuration.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-05-30T17:45:23.456Z",
  "openaiConfigured": true
}
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended for Web)
1. Build the web version: `npx expo export:web`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Vercel
3. Configure Vercel to serve the static files

### Expo Application Services (EAS)
For mobile app deployment:
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
npx expo build
```

## Development Notes

- The app is optimized for mobile-first design but works great on desktop
- Chart visualizations are responsive and adapt to screen size
- AI assistant integrates with OpenAI API (with local fallback)
- Core mortgage calculations are performed client-side for privacy
- Requires OpenAI API key for AI assistant functionality
